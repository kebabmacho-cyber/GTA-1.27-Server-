**More Helpful Utilities, that i forgot about (found on drives and completely forgotten about)**
- [grabbing missions v2](https://github.com/Safauri/gta-download-missions-v2) — Mission data extractor (suppose to grab the missions and make into a folder with the mission id) (this was made a while ago just refound it in my drives)
- [mp stats setup](https://github.com/Safauri/mpstatssetup-js) - reads the 'mpstatssetup.xml' grabs the stat names filters it and makes them into jenkinsHash
